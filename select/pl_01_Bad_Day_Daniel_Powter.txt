Where is the moment we needed
the most?
You kick up the leaves and the
magic is lost
You tell me your blue skies fade
to grey
You tell me your passion's gone
away
And I don't need no carrying on
You stand in the line just to
hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the
coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way
off line
You're falling to pieces every
time
And I don't need no carrying on
'Cause you had a bad day, you're
taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn
it around
You say you don't know, you tell
me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go
for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera
don't lie
You're coming back down and you
really don't mind
You had a bad day, you had a bad
day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what
you say
And I don't need no carrying on
You had a bad day, you're taking
one down
You sing a sad song just to turn
it around
You say you don't know, you tell
me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go
for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera
don't lie
You're coming back down and you
really don't mind
You had a bad day, Oh, Holiday
Sometimes the system goes on the
blink
And the whole thing turns out
wrong
You might not make it back and
you know
That you could be well Oh that
strong and I'm not wrong
Yeah-Eh-Eh-Eh-Yeah
So where is the passion when you
need it the most?
Oh, you and I, you kick up the
leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day, you're
taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn
it around
You say you don't know, you tell
me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go
for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen
what you like
And how does it feel, for one
more time?
You had a bad day, you had a bad
day
(Oh, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) Had a bad
day
(Oh, had a bad day) Had a bad
day
(Oh, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) Had a bad
day
(Oh, had a bad day) Had a bad
day
